# How to run the scripts 
#### 0. Before runing the scripts...
You will need to adjust the chrome profile at this section inside `run_script.sh` at `--profile-directory...`.

```# Start Chrome in debug mode (if not already running)
if ! pgrep -f "chrome.*remote-debugging-port=9222" > /dev/null; then
    echo "ðŸš€ Starting Chrome in debug mode..."
    google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
                  --user-data-dir="/home/samuel/.config/google-chrome/" \
                  --profile-directory="Default" \
                  --disable-gpu 2>/dev/null &
```

####  1. Clone the repository  
 ```git clone git@github.com:xxeonN22/pv247-homework-scripts.git```

#### 2. Navigate to the folder of cloned repository  
```cd pv247-homework-scripts```

#### 3. Make the scripts executable
```chmod +x run_script.sh && chmod +x klonovanie_py```

#### 4. Run the script without arguments to see how to run the script
```./run_script.sh```

#### 5. Run the script with arguments
If u dont want to be moved to the `cloned_repos` directory automatically after cloning repositories  
```./run_script.sh "<HOMEWORK_URL>" "<HOMEWORK_FOLDER>" <NUMBER_OF_HOMEWORK>``` e.g.  

```./run_script.sh "https://pv247-app.vercel.app/lector/homeworks/styling?type=own" "styling" 3```

If u want to be moved to the `cloned_repos` directory automatically after cloning repositories   
```source run_script.sh "<HOMEWORK_URL>" "<HOMEWORK_FOLDER>" <NUMBER_OF_HOMEWORK>``` e.g.  

```source run_script.sh "https://pv247-app.vercel.app/lector/homeworks/styling?type=own" "styling" 3```

#### 6. Runing the script 

This is how it looks like, when you will clone the repositories you havent reviewed yet.

This is how it looks like, when u already reviewed homeworks, but acidentally removed `reviewed_repos.txt` file. 
When the script will find out, that pull request contains `H(h)odnotenie` or `H(h)odnoceni` or `E(e)valuation` keyword, it will be marked as already reviewed and put inside `reviewed_repos.txt` file so it will not go through
the next time you will run the script.

This is how it looks like, when runing script again when homeworks of the students were already evaluated

#### 7. Run the script to process repositories one by one
After cloning repositories, you will see something like this  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecae9817-151b-4943-93e6-5a1b75afd209)

If u run the script using `source` you will be already inside `cloned_repos` folder as mentioned at 5th. step.
Now you can run another script `run_repos.sh` using either `dev` or `build`  

```./run_repos.sh build``` - suitable for first homework - typescript
 * Runing this should open VSC, open intergrated terminal, write npm install && npm run build, open URL with student's pull request
```./run_repos.sh dev```
 * Runing this should open VSC, open intergrated terminal, write npm install && npm run dev, open URL with student's pull request and also server on localhost:3000

So it will look something like this :  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/488a0d8f-9201-42d7-b20e-bad5162956bb)

As mentioned earlier, it will open VSC with intergrated terminal where it will put the command either `npm install && npm run build` or `npm install && npm run dev` based on the argument when runing script.
It will process repositories on by one - it will open also URL with pull request of given student and the live server if the `dev` argument is present.
You can then review the homework. After you are done, you should press `Enter` key to proceed to the next repository. 
You should not touch anything during opening etc. because certain things need to be focused to work properly.

After pressing `Enter`, the repository will be added to the `processed_repos.txt` file so it will not go through the next time you will run the script.
